- 👋 Hi, I’m @IdlePX
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and terrible puns.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Openbox, Sway, and all the ways I can break OpenSUSE.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, because I'm still learning. Walk before you swim, and all that.
- 📫 How to reach me on Twitter? Sure, @idlePX. Say hi.
